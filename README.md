# Current Issues I am working on
<ul>
  <li> The sectored antennas seem to be showing different radiation power depending on direction. See image below </li>
  <img src="figs/difference_in_sectors.png">
  <li> Determine how to randomly place Rx_tracks while maintaining spacial consistency. </li>
  <li> Create system for generating many small powermaps with different scenarios, concatenating, and smoothing them. </li>
</ul>
